# Hunter 

This mod adds a custom survivor to Risk of Rain Returns; the Hunter. 

The Hunter is a galactic warrior who collects relics (not yet implemented) from an ancient race to expand her abilities. Use Missiles to blast huddled groups of enemies and Morph Bombs to lay a trap while making a clean getaway. Remember that you can walljump or propel yourself up with Bombs to scale heights!

### Walljumping

To walljump, you must be airborne and touching a wall, then hold away from the wall and quickly press the jump button to boost off of it.

### Note

This mod is not yet finished, as I have many future plans for the Hunter and her capabilities. This first release just has everything I believe I need to make a working survivor.

Currently, she gains hidden powerups as her level increases.
- Missiles: Gain an extra stock of your secondary skill every level.
- Hi-Jump Boots: At level 8, gain a significant boost to jump height.
- Space Jump Boots: Starting at level 16, gain one extra midair jump every level.
- Varia: At level 12, gain 50 armor.
- Gravity: At level 16, gain 50 armor. Become immune to the slow-goop debuff from Hive Cluster and the lava in Magma Barracks, and increased fall speed in water.
- Spazer: At level 11, fire 2 extra beams from your primary.
- Ice: At level 13, have a chance to freeze and snare enemies with beams.
- Wave: At level 15, beams travel through walls.
- Plasma: At level 17, beams travel through non-boss enemies, dealing massive damage.

There are also a modGUI options to reduce the lag caused by having too many beams.

## Multiplayer

Multiplayer technically works, but there may be multiplayer-specific bugs. Please contact me if you encounter any issues.
 - Known:
   - Online players can damage enemies with invisible beams with Destroy Offscreen Beams enabled (this one is intentional for now).
   - Standing on a fully solid enemy as it unfreezes will allow the player to stand in midair until they move or jump.
   - Multi-segment enemies only allow you to stand on their primary segment when frozen (i.e. bramble legs).
   - If you stand inside a large enemy and freeze them you may get stuck.
   - The Beam Limit setting may occasionally crash clients in multiplayer in late stages of the run.


## Contact
