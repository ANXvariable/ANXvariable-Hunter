# Hunter 

This mod adds a custom survivor to Risk of Rain Returns; the Hunter. 

The Hunter is a galactic warrior who collects relics (not yet implemented) from an ancient race to expand her abilities. Use Missiles to blast huddled groups of enemies and Morph Bombs to lay a trap while making a clean getaway. Remember that you can walljump or propel yourself up with Bombs to scale heights!

### Walljumping

To walljump, you must be airborne and touching a wall, then hold away from the wall and quickly press the jump button to boost off of it.

### Note

This mod is not yet finished, as I have many future plans for the Hunter and her capabilities. This first release just has everything I believe I need to make a working survivor.

Currently, she gains hidden powerups as her level increases.

There is also a modGUI option to reduce the lag caused by having too many beams on screen. Enabling it will cause the oldest beams to be destroyed when there are too many.
